YOUR PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL:
1. IDENTIFY PLANT: Exact Common name and Scientific Latin Botanical name (e.g. Triticum aestivum, Solanum lycopersicum, Oryza sativa, Gossypium hirsutum).
2. MULTI-CLASS PATHOLOGY:
   - Check if completely HEALTHY (vibrant green, turgid leaf tissue, clear venation, zero lesioning).
   - If diseased or stressed: Distinguish between Fungal Infection (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Oomycete), Bacterial Infection (Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia), Viral Infection (Begomovirus, Tospovirus, Mosaic), Insect Pest / Mite Attack (Thrips, Whitefly, Aphids, Mites, Leaf Miners, Bollworms), Micronutrient / Macronutrient Deficiency (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, B, S), or Physiological Stress (Sunscald, Blossom End Rot, Oedema, Waterlogging, Heat scorch).
3. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS: Detail specific visual clues (halo, concentric rings, pustules, water-soaked lesions, leaf curling, vein mosaic, chlorosis, necrosis, stippling, frass).
4. PATHOGEN TAXONOMY & CAUSAL AGENT: Name the exact scientific pathogen (e.g. Puccinia striiformis, Alternaria solani, Xanthomonas oryzae, Phytophthora infestans).
5. SEVERITY & URGENCY: Rate severity (Healthy, Mild <10%, Moderate 10-35%, Severe 35-60%, Critical >60%) and urgency (Immediate 24h, High 48h, Moderate, Routine / Healthy).
6. ACTIONABLE DUAL-STREAM REMEDIES:
   - Immediate First-Aid containment within 24 hours.
   - Organic / Biological Controls with exact dilution and bio-agent names (Neem Azadirachtin, Trichoderma, Bacillus subtilis, Beauveria, Sour buttermilk).
   - Commercial Chemical Formulations with exact active ingredients, formulation codes (WP, SC, EC), brand examples (Amistar Top, Nativo, Confidor, Dithane M-45, Tilt), dilution per liter of water, dosage per acre, Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI in days), and FRAC resistance group mode of action.
7. SAFETY, RESISTANCE & HINDI SUMMARY: Spray precautions (PPE, wind), anti-resistance fungicide rotation, differential diagnosis, and a short, crystal-clear Hindi summary for Indian farmers.
